      h3 Pricing for Paid Courses
      h4 Key Definitions
      p
        strong "Base Price"
        | means the course price set by the Instructor.
        br
        strong "Base Currency"
        | means the currency of the Base Price.
        br
        strong "Base Exchange Rate"
        | means a system-wide rate used by the Company for foreign currency conversion and does not include any fee or mark-up by the Company. The rate is established using one or more third parties such as Open Exchange Rates and is fixed periodically (e.g. monthly) to prevent daily price fluctuations. Accordingly, the Base Exchange Rate may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect at the specific time a foreign currency conversion is processed.
        br
        strong "Sale Price"
        | means the actual sale price for the Course. When the Sale Currency is different from the Base Currency, the Company will determine the Sale Price based on the applicable Base Exchange Rate and Cost Adjustment Factor.
        br
        strong "Sale Currency"
        | means the currency of the sale. This is determined by the country of origin of the User purchasing the Course.
        br
        strong "Cost Adjustment Factor"
        | means applicable local taxes and other fees associated with currency conversions. In regions that use a common currency, e.g., the EU, the Cost Adjustment Factor uses a weighted average of country specific tax rates to ensure the same prices to end customers across the region.
      h4 Pricing
      p Except when a Course is made available through the You Will Change The World Marketing Programs, or a Course is offered on Company's iOS mobile applications, an Instructor will be solely responsible for determining the Base Price to be charged for such Course, in accordance with the Instructor Terms . In the case of Courses offered on Company's iOS applications, Company will select the Apple App Store price tier (App Store Pricing Matrix available here) that is closest to the fee set by the Instructor. When the Sale Currency is different than the Base Currency, the Company will determine the Sale Price according to the most recent Base Exchange Rate and applicable Cost Adjustment Factor.
      p If You are a Student, You agree to pay the fees for Courses that You take, and hereby authorize Us to charge Your credit card for these amounts. We will charge Your credit card monthly for all amounts owed. If Your credit card is declined, You agree to pay Us the fees within thirty (30) days of notification from Us, and pay (at Our discretion) a late payment charge at 1.5% per month, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is greater.
      h4 Taxes
      p
        strong European Union
        br
        | In the event that the sale or delivery of a Course or any Submitted Content to any Student in the European Union is subject to any value added tax ("VAT"), under applicable law, You Will Change The World will collect and remit the VAT to the competent tax authorities for sales of such Courses or Submitted Content to Students in the European Union. You Will Change The World may at its own discretion increase the Sale Price where You Will Change The World is of the view that VAT may be due and You Will Change The World will have a liability to account for such. You will indemnify and hold You Will Change The World harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for any underpayment of VAT, and any penalties and/or interest thereon.
        br
        strong All other countries
        | For sales of any of Courses or Submitted Content in countries other than the European Union, You are responsible for remitting the taxes to the appropriate taxing authority (which may be different to the tax authority in your own location). You Will Change The World is unable to provide you with tax advice and You should consult your own tax advisor.
      h4 Rounding Off
      p Company may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down the Sale Price to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the Sale Currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, Company will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00.
      p Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Company may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for Company to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.
      h4 Foreign Currency
      p Company's online platform will default the Sale Currency based on Your geographic location. The currency of any transaction will match the Sale Currency displayed to You on the website. You cannot change Your displayed currency.
      p Each foreign currency conversion is processed at a foreign currency conversion rate. This rate generally refers to the amount of one currency that must be paid to buy a certain amount of another currency at a given time. For example, if it costs US$125.00 to buy €100.00, the currency conversion rate of US dollars to Euros would be 1.25, and the currency conversion rate from Euros to US dollars would be 0.8. Currency conversion rates will vary from time to time.
      h4 Refunds
      p You Will Change The World offers Students a thirty (30)-day, no-questions-asked money back guarantee on Courses that are not purchased through You Will Change The World's iOS or Android applications.

Neither Instructors nor Company shall receive any payments, fees or commissions for any transactions for which a refund has been granted. In the event that a Student requests a refund for a Course after You Will Change The World has sent an Instructor payment for that Course, You Will Change The World reserves the right to either (1) deduct the amount of such refund from the next payment to be sent to that Instructor, or (2) require that Instructor to refund any amounts refunded to Students for Instructor's Course to the extent no additional payments are due from You Will Change The World to Instructor or such payments due Instructor are insufficient to cover the amounts refunded to Students.
