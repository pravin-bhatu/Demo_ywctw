      p This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how You Will Change The World, LLC (“You Will Change The World,” “we” or “us”) collect, use and share personally identifiable information of visitors of our web site (the “Site”) and users of our products and services (the “Services”). Please note that the primary purpose of our Site and the Services it to allow you to enroll in and take online courses on a variety of topics (“Courses”). For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, information that you provide through the Site can be in one of two categories: information relating to your use of the Site or the Services, including, without limitation, enrollment information for Courses, is referred to as “Site Information,” while information relating to taking the Courses, including, without limitation, interchanges with the Course instructors (“Instructors”), other students (“Users”), answers, essays and other items submitted to satisfy Course requirements, is referred to as “Course Information.” When this Privacy Policy uses the generic term “information” it is intended to address the general use of information, and not your specific Site Information or Course Information.

We use this Site Information to fulfill your request. We may also use this Site Information to send you additional information about our Services or Courses on the Site that you may be interested in.
      p Some of the Services require that you become a registered user and create a user account. This will require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, that may include (but not be limited to) your (and if you are enrolling as part of our You Will Change The World for Business program) your company’s name, e-mail address, as well as telephone and address information.
      p You allow us to use this personally identifiable Site Information to register you to use the Services, enroll in Courses, and otherwise provide you with the Services; verify your authority to enter the Site and access the Courses and Services; notify you of updates; improve the content and general administration of the Site and the Services; provide you with notices regarding the Services and other services that you have purchased or may wish to purchase in the future.

You Will Change The World does not control these uses by Instructors.

      p You Will Change The World may also automatically collect and analyze Site Information about your general usage of the Site, Services and Courses. We might track your usage patterns to see what features of the Site, Services and Courses you commonly use, Site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser, browser language, IP address and operating system, and statistical information about how you use the Services and Courses. We only collect, track and analyze such Site Information in an aggregate manner that does not personally identify you.
